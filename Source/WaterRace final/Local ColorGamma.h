//
//	ColorGammaLib
//
//		by Drew Thaler (athaler@umich.edu)
//		with help and technical advice from Matt Slot (fprefect@AmbrosiaSW.com)
//		based in part on Matt Slot's Gamma Fader lib v1.2.
//
//	This library is public domain.
//
//	Send comments and suggestions to me (drew) at <athaler@umich.edu>.  I don't know
//	if I'll really be able to handle every bug report, but I'd be interested in
//	hearing from anyone who finds it useful or has suggestions for improvements.
//	Because of variations in video hardware, there's no guarantee that this stuff
//	will necessarily work for you or for your users... but it works for me, and
//	everyone i've given it to so far.  The author shall not be held liable for
//	any possible damage, etc, that might result from use of this library... use
//	it at your own risk.  It's public domain, after all.  =)
//	
//	If you release software that takes advantage of this lib, it'd be awfully
//	kind of you to send me a copy of the finished product by way of thanks, but it's
//	certainly not necessary.  Although I *am* a poor college student who would
//	greatly appreciate such a gift.... ;)
//
//
//
//	Contents:
//
//		Everything you need to do a color gamma fade.  Includes a high-level
//		API with calls such as FadeToColor and FadeToBlack, and a low-level API
//		for when you absolutely need that extra bit of control.  Data storage
//		is maintained in handles to be easy on your heap and prevent fragmentation.
//
//	Technical background:
//
//		Fading the screen to a color is a cool special effect.  There are several
//		ways to do it... 'clut'-fading is one well-known technique for doing this
//		type of fade by altering a monitor's color lookup table.  There's one caveat,
//		though: it doesn't work in thousands or millions of colors, since those are
//		direct-rgb modes that don't use cluts.  Gamma fading is the other option,
//		but although there was a public domain lib to do percentage gamma fades
//		to black, there hasn't been a free library to do gamma fading to an
//		arbitrary color... until now, that is.  :>
//		
//		Color gamma fading is accomplished by fading the three channels of a
//		screen's gamma table in the ratio of the r-g-b values of the color.
//		The speed of a color gamma fade is generally much better than a 'clut'
//		fade, providing silky-smooth transitions on both 68K and PPC.
//
//	High-level API
//
//		The gamma state of the attached monitor(s) is maintained in an opaque
//		data structure called a GammaRef by the library.  Before fading, the
//		user must call StartFading to retrieve the initial gamma state, and
//		then StopFading afterward to dispose of the allocated state.
//		StopFading can optionally restore the unmodified initial state before
//		disposing of the GammaRef.  This is highly recommended, in case the gamma
//		fader lib has screwed up somehow -- only in extraordinary circumstances
//		would you ever *not* want to do this.
//		
//		The high-level API consists of three functions: FadeToColor, FadeToGamma,
//		and FadeToBlack, with corresponding single-monitor versions.  FadeToColor
//		takes a color to fade to as an argument, and FadeToGamma accepts a GammaRef
//		similarly.  You can specify the number of steps in the fade (more steps take
//		longer) and the type of fade to perform -- either linear, quadratic, or
//		inverse quadratic. A linear fade does a straight interpolated fade between
//		the two states, while the quadratic fade starts slowly and "accelerates" as
//		it nears the destination.  (This looks good for a fade to black.)  Inverse
//		quadratic is the opposite of quadratic, starting quickly and slowing
//		down as it nears the destination.
//
//		Before calling StopFading, you generally would call FadeToGamma with the
//		initial state returned by StartFading to fade back into normal, rather than
//		abruptly switching into it.
//		
//	Low-level API
//		
//		The low-level API provides more control, and allows you to do other things
//		during a fade rather than just sit there.  I'm not going to go into great
//		detail here... the functions are mostly self-explanatory, and the source is
//		provided.  Figure it out.
//		
//		Note that as far as I can figure, the low-level API (with the exception of
//		the ones that return GammaRefs, of course) does not move memory and therefore
//		might be safe to call from interrupt time!?  Don't quote me on that one,
//		since I've never tested it, but the only Toolbox calls made by the two low-level
//		fade calls are BlockMoveData, PBControl, Get/SetGDevice, and SetEntries.  So if
//		you really NEED to do fades at interrupt time, and enjoy living on the edge,
//		it might just work.  Personally, I wouldn't recommend it, but you know, some
//		people are crazy like that.
//	
//	Compilation notes
//
//		By default, ColorGamma will try to link to the ANSI memset function to avoid
//		unnecessary code duplication.  If you're not linking with the ANSI libs in
//		your project, change the flags at the beginning of the file and #define
//		EXTERN_MEMSET false.  There are a few other compilation flags... check out
//		the .c file to see all of them.  (they're right at the top.)
//
//	Other notes
//
//		Thanks to Matt Slot for his input on the high-level API, and the tipoff on
//		how to do the color gamma fade in the first place.  Thanks also to DaveK,
//		whyte and everyone else who beta-tested this lib on #macdev.
